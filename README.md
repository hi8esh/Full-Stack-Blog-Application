# Full-Stack-Blog-Application
This is a full stack blog application consists of several features -
1. Contains several pages such as Home page and About page.
2. We can do several things like load articles and display them.
3. We can also allow users to Up-vote the articles.
4. We can also allow adding comments.
5. We can also let user log in and out, so that we can keep track of who users are when they add comments, and make sure a user can only add a certain number of Up-vote to each of the articles.


## Why React?
<<<<<<< HEAD
It makes creating a website simpler and faster without taking away any of the fine grained control from the programmer. It allow us to create modular reusable components that can then be arranges into fully functional website instead of hand coding each individual page in our site.

## Why Node.js?
We don't have to depend on PHP or Python or Java for backend, instead we can use javascript for both frontend and backend. There are many different npm packages that can be used to create Node.js servers, The one that We are using is Express.

### Why Express?
It is a great choice for us because it is unopinionated, it's very easy to get started with, very well documented. And most importantly there are a ton of third-party add-ons that can be used to extend Express's functionality.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
